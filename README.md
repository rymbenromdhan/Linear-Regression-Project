###Linear Regression Project
##Overview
This project explores salary trends using a salary dataset and builds a regression model to analyze and predict salaries. The goal is to uncover patterns and relationships in the data while applying linear regression techniques.

##Key Steps
#Data Preparation:

Cleaned and preprocessed the salary dataset for analysis.

Handled missing values and ensured data consistency.

#Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualized relationships between features and salaries.

Identified key trends and insights from the data.

#Model Development:

Applied linear regression to model salary predictions.

Evaluated model performance using appropriate metrics.

##Tools and Libraries
Python: For data processing, analysis, and modeling.

Pandas, NumPy: Data manipulation.

Matplotlib, Seaborn: Data visualization.

Scikit-learn: Linear regression modeling.

##Results
Discovered trends and significant factors influencing salaries.

Built a linear regression model to predict salaries effectively.
